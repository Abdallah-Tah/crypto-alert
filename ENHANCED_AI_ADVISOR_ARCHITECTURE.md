    'recommendation' => $this->extractRecommendation($response),
    'price_targets' => $this->extractPriceTargets($response),
    'risk_level' => $this->extractRiskLevel($response),
    'confidence' => $this->extractConfidence($response),
    'key_points' => $this->extractKeyPoints($response)
];
```

### 3. Caching Strategy
- **Market Intelligence**: 30 minutes (balances freshness vs. API costs)
- **News Sentiment**: 15 minutes (rapid sentiment changes)
- **Technical Analysis**: Real-time (price-sensitive)

## 📊 Data Quality & Confidence Scoring

### Confidence Calculation
```php
private function calculateConfidenceScore(array $marketData, array $newsData, array $technicalData): int
{
    $marketConfidence = ($marketData['confidence'] ?? 0) * 40;    // 40% weight
    $newsConfidence = ($newsData['confidence'] ?? 0) * 30;        // 30% weight  
    $technicalConfidence = ($technicalData['reliability'] ?? 0) * 30; // 30% weight
    
    return round($marketConfidence + $newsConfidence + $technicalConfidence);
}
```
