## üß© **Frontend UX Workflow (Inertia.js + Vue/React)**

### üè† 1. **Home/Dashboard Page**

> `/dashboard`

#### UX Flow:

* Welcome message with greeting and user‚Äôs portfolio balance
* Overview cards: **Top Coins**, **Your Watchlist**, **AI Suggestions**
* Action button: "Add Coin to Watchlist"

#### Components:

* `<PortfolioSummary />`
* `<LiveTickerCard />`
* `<AISummaryPanel />`
* `<WatchlistGrid />`

---

### üìà 2. **Watchlist Page**

> `/watchlist`

#### UX Flow:

* User can search and select coins (via dropdown or autocomplete)
* Display coin cards with:

  * Current price
  * % change
  * Alert status (ON/OFF)
  * Remove icon

#### Components:

* `<WatchlistCard />`
* `<AddWatchlistModal />`
* `<PriceAlertToggle />`

---

### ü§ñ 3. **AI Advisor Page**

> `/advisor`

#### UX Flow:

* Questionnaire: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your risk level?‚Äù, ‚ÄúDo you want long-term or short-term?‚Äù
* Submit ‚Üí Calls OpenAI API for suggestion
* Show suggestion in AI message box

#### Components:

* `<RiskSelector />`
* `<TimeHorizonRadio />`
* `<AIAdviceBox />`

---

### üîî 4. **Notifications Page (optional)**

> `/alerts`

* Display triggered alerts with timestamps
* Group by coin or importance
* Action: "Acknowledge" or "Rebalance"

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 5. **Settings Page**

> `/settings`

* Notification toggle
* Base currency (USD, EUR, etc.)
* Dark/light mode
* API Key management (optional for trading)

---

## üéØ UX Tips:

* Use **TailwindCSS** for mobile-first responsiveness
* Use **Vue transitions** for smooth dropdowns/modals
* Stick to **bottom nav bar** for quick access on mobile
* Show **feedback** after AI advice or alert set

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Backend Workflow (Laravel + NativePHP + CCXT + OpenAI)**

### üß© 1. **User Flow: Watchlist**

* **CreateCoinController** ‚Üí user selects coin ‚Üí save to `watchlist` table
* Scheduled job: `FetchCryptoPrices` checks watchlist prices via **CCXT**
* If price alert condition met ‚Üí queue **SendPushNotification**
* Optionally logs snapshot into `price_snapshots` table

---

### üß† 2. **Smart Advisor Flow**

* AIAdvisorController gets:
  * `latest_price` from CCXT
  * `24h_change` from CCXT  
  * `user risk level` from form
  * `time_horizon` from form
* Uses **Prism PHP** to send structured prompt to **OpenAI**
* Stores response to `ai_suggestions` table with metadata
* Returns structured advice via Inertia to React component
* Optionally triggers AI suggestion notification

---

### üßæ 3. **Backend Tables**

```php
users
watchlist (user_id, symbol, alert_price, enabled)
price_snapshots (watchlist_id, price, captured_at)
ai_suggestions (user_id, symbol, suggestion, model_used, created_at)
```

---

### üîî 4. **Push Notification System**

```php
Notification::title('üö® ETH Alert!')
    ->body('ETH just crossed $3,800. Time to rebalance?')
    ->send();
```

Trigger this via:

* price job
* or AI suggestion queue

---

### üîê 5. **Local Preferences via NativePHP**

```php
Storage::put('preferences', [
    'risk' => 'moderate',
    'alerts_enabled' => true
]);

$userPrefs = Storage::get('preferences');
```

---

### üí° Services Breakdown

* `CCXTService.php`: handles fetching ticker data from Binance, Coinbase, etc.
* `AIAdvisorService.php`: wraps OpenAI prompts using **Prism PHP** for structured responses
* `AlertService.php`: triggers push notifications and logs alert actions
* `WatchlistService.php`: handles add/remove/toggle alerts with real-time price integration
* `UserPreferencesService.php`: manages local storage via NativePHP for offline preferences

---

### üèóÔ∏è **Production Implementation Details**

#### **Dependencies & Packages**

```bash
# Core crypto market data
composer require ccxt/ccxt

# AI integration with structured responses
composer require prism-php/prism

# Laravel ecosystem
composer require laravel/breeze  # Authentication
composer require inertiajs/inertia-laravel  # SPA framework
composer require tightenco/ziggy  # Route helpers for frontend

# NativePHP for desktop/mobile
composer require nativephp/electron  # For desktop app
```

#### **Database Migrations Priority**

1. `create_watchlists_table` - Core functionality
2. `create_ai_suggestions_table` - AI advisor feature  
3. `create_alerts_table` - Notification system
4. `create_price_snapshots_table` - Historical data (optional)
5. `create_user_preferences_table` - Settings storage

#### **Environment Configuration**

```env
# OpenAI Integration (Prism PHP)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
OPENAI_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
OPENAI_ORGANIZATION=
OPENAI_PROJECT=

# CCXT Exchange APIs
CCXT_DEFAULT_EXCHANGE=binance
BINANCE_API_KEY=...
BINANCE_SECRET=...
BINANCE_SANDBOX=false

# NativePHP Configuration
NATIVE_PHP_ENVIRONMENT=production
NATIVE_PHP_NOTIFICATIONS=true

# Application
APP_NAME="Crypto Alert Pro"
APP_URL=https://crypto-alert.app
```

#### **Scheduled Jobs & Queues**

```php
// In app/Console/Kernel.php
$schedule->job(CheckPriceAlertsJob::class)->everyMinute();
$schedule->job(FetchMarketDataJob::class)->everyFiveMinutes();
$schedule->job(CleanupOldAlertsJob::class)->daily();
```

#### **API Rate Limiting & Caching**

* CCXT: 1000ms rate limit between requests
* OpenAI: Cache suggestions for 1 hour to avoid duplicate calls
* Redis for real-time price caching (5-minute expiry)
* Database query optimization with proper indexing

---

### üß™ Testing Locally

```bash
php artisan native:run
```

To build:

```bash
php artisan native:build android
```
